## How to use the pagebuilder

To use the builder you need to add the following in you blade file i recommend to use a blank blade file.

```html
<x-onix::onix.main
    cssPath="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" // Not Required
    javascriptPath="https://youraplication.js" // Not Required
    imageAssetUrlLoader="{{ route('onix.image.load') }}" // Not Required
    imageAssetUrlSave="{{ route('onix.image.save') }}" // Not Required
    saveUrl="{{ route('onix.save') }}" // Not Required
    loadUrl="{{ route('onix.load') }}" // Not Required
    autoLoadingUrl="{{ route('onix.component.load') }}" // Not Required
/>
```

1. css Path you can add you own css for example bootstrap or tailwind css by default onix use tailwind
2. imageAssetUrlLoader route you can load the images
3. imageAssetUrlSave route where you can upload images and save in the database
4. saveUrl url where you want to save your url
5. loadUrl exemple to load the pagebuilder
6. autoLoadingUrl this is where you can autoload components from Api request
